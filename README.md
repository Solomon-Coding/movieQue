# movieQue - Movie Tracker

## Description

We created movieQue because we wanted to make a professional-looking web application to aid the needs of moviegoers.

We wanted to create an application that would allow users to look up movies, find information about them and where to watch them on streaming services, and additionally make lists of the many movies that they would like to watch, and have already watched. These lists are persistent on movieQue, so users can come back and add to or delete from those lists whenever they want. 

Through the course of this project, we learned more about the methods used to get information from 3rd party APIs, and how to time everything correctly to display them on a webpage. We also learned more about the nature of collaborative projects and how to work with a Minimum Viable Product and deadlines in mind.

## User Story
 - Given a movie tracker web application. 
	- WHEN a user looks up a movie. 
	- THEN the user finds a description, ratings, trailer, poster, add to lists buttons, and a “where to watch” section.
	- WHEN a user adds a movie to one of the lists 
	- THEN the user can view that movie in one of the lists. 
	- WHEN a user views their "movies watched" or "movies to watch" lists 
	- THEN the user can delete options on their lists.
